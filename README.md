# Exquisite Graveyard

Welcome to Exquisite Graveyard. 

Exquisite Graveyard is a progressive web application based on a drawing exercise invented by surrealists in the 1920s.

Each player adds to a drawing in sequence without seeing the previous contributions, except for a snippet of the previous drawing. When the drawing is complete, it's then revealed to all the players.
