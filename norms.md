# XCORP!!!

## Standard Norms
- Share the mic
- Don't interrupt - raise your hand
- Share frustrations in a constructive matter
- Write a GitHub issue
- Ask for help
- Commit frequently
- Deploy early
- Choose a code style and stick to it
- Keep each other updated
- Disagreements many, arguments few

## Additional Norms
- Say what you're thinking, advocate for yourself

- try to write "self-documenting" code - when in doubt, leave a comment 
Be able to explain your code to the group so that we can all eventually understand all parts of the application. es-lint, no semi-colons

- when disagreements arise and can't be settled between parties easily 
each can make their case and the whole group can vote. Consult fellow/instructor when there's a tie or we need more info.

- if someone is frustrated:
For the person who is frustrated: try to understand why and if/what your group can do for you to help.
For the group: consider offering to unload some of their workload, to pair, or just checking in
For all: avoid hostile, assumptive, or accusatory language. take space/time if heated (don't let things escalate)

- have someone review your PR before merging to master. potentially mutliple parties if the work touches multiple points in the code. Test immediately after the merge. And have the team pull from master as soon as any bugs from the merge are fixed

- after 15 min of "productive struggle" reach out to other memmber(s) of the group. if still unresolved escalate to help ticket etc. Make sure to have covered your bases by referring to previous lectures, workshops, documentation, stackoverflow, Google!

- incorporate pairing as much as possible. encourage learning and communication between group members. pairs can choose their own pairing norms (ie timers, roles)


- Stay in touch on Slack about any and all after-hours work. You don't need to wait for a reply to a Slack message to start on a feature, but make sure to check slack and announce your intentions before beginning. Try to have an evening stand-up/check-in to pre-plan as much as possible outside work. 

- Daily Stand Ups first thing and last thing
