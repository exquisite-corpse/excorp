## How We Work As A Team
1. What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?

*Each party can make their case and the whole group can vote. Consult fellow when there's a tie or we need more info.*

2. What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.

*Any discussions should be with the whole group.*

*Person A - "Do you want to pair program or split your work load? It seems like you have some bandwidth. Are you stuck on something, or do you need more work. I notice you haven't committed in a while."*

3. What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?

*We'll have the reviewer merge the branch. If there's a problem, we'll involve the whole team. Changes can stay between pusher and reviewer.*

4. When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?

*15 minute rule after at least 2 people have worked on the problem. Consult each other, consult fellow.*

5. How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?

*We'll pair if 2 people really want to work on something, or if someone is stuck. We'll discuss at Stand Up if pairing is needed or wanted for that day. The pairs can decide on norms.*

6. How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?

*Keep each other informed on Slack, keep after-hours features small and doable. You don't need a reply to a Slack message to start on a feature. Friday afternoon/evening stand up to discuss weekend plans.*

7. What time does this group have daily stand up?

*We'll have Stand Up after REACTO and before the day's work begins.*
